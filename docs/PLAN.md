# PLAN

This is the planning document for the library.

## asX

Airlib subsystem for X is a `module` abstracting X11 API, making it easier with simple dummy functions.
The primary rendering and window management library is wGL and GLx.

`asX` is deprecated as of November 2024.

## Stellar Engine

The archived StellarEngine will be back as a fork of [Tilengine](https://tilengin.org) using Airlib rather than SDL.
