> [!NOTE]
> The [old library](../include/old.h) will get some more functionalities :

- Unicode printing
- Placeholders, prefixes and helper texts

## Windows

- [x] Window Management
- [x] AUDIO 

## Sub Libraries

There will some sub-libraries referred as `modules`, e.g. LibreArrays.

### LibreArrays

LibreArrays is a `module` for array calculations like [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html).

### agGL

Airlib Graphics abstraction for OpenGL is a `module` abstracting OpenGL and making OpenGL graphics handling easier.

## WinAPI

Buy the time `agGL` will be done, having all actual WinAPI graphics features, WIN_graphics will be deprecated, due to it's rude syntax;
